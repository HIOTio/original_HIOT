A thing manages Sensors and Controller

a config.json file is used to:
- Identify this device
- Define relevant Aggregator and Broker
- Maintain a list of attached sensors and Controllers.

A demo controller (which echos received commands to the console) and a demo sensor (returns a random number between 0 adn 100) have been included.

Other examples of controllers and sensors can be found in their top level directories
