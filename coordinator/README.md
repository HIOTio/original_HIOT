The Coordinator is the end-point connecting the HIOT deployment with the Platform (regardless of where the Platform is deployed).

No other devices in the deployment can communicate beyond the Coordinator (e.g. to the Platform, or directly to a client device).

Each physical site has one active Coordinator, the role can be deployed on multiple devices but only one can be active at any time
